# Code-under review (will be updated soon)
# Personalized Learning and Skill Assessment Platform

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Personalized Learning and Skill Assessment Platform utilizing advanced predictive analytics, cloud integration, and large language models (LLMs). The platform will provide personalized feedback and recommendations to enhance students' learning experiences and assess their skills effectively.

### Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:

1. **UCI Student Performance Dataset**: Contains data on students' academic performance, including grades, school activities, and demographics.
2. **Kaggle Student Performance Dataset**: Includes information on student assessments, courses, and interactions with the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Handling & Preprocessing**
   - Load datasets.
   - Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
   - Merge datasets as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform initial analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Visualize key metrics and trends.

3. **Model Development**
   - Implement predictive models to assess student performance.
   - Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized feedback and recommendations.

4. **Deployment & Integration**
   - Deploy the model and integrate with Azure for cloud-based services.
   - Use Streamlit for the front-end interface.
   - Store and manage data with Google Firebase.
   - Visualize results and insights using Tableau Public.

5. **Evaluation & Feedback**
   - Evaluate model performance and accuracy.
   - Gather feedback to iteratively improve the platform.

### Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. Install required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the data preprocessing scripts:

    ```sh
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```

5. Start the Streamlit app:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Usage

- Access the Streamlit application via the web browser to interact with the platform.
- Use the application to input student data and receive personalized recommendations and feedback.
